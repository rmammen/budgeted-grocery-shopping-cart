                need some way to map "fruit" to the cost of "fruit/vegetable"
                
                SUGGESTED FIX: 
                OPTION 1: modify the pandas dataframe directly to split items with "/" in description into separate rows
                OPTION 2: read the df into a dictionary. { itemDescription:string -> price:float }
                          loop through all keys and find items with "/" in description. modify the dictionary to store the two
                          different items.
                
                PROS/CONS:
                Option 1 is easier if you are more familiar with pandas and are comforatble modifying the dataframe. Option 2 is more 
                resource intensive but is easier to code.
